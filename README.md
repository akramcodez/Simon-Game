# Simon-Game
Constructed a responsive Simon Game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating expertise in front-end development and game logic.
I created a logic system for a Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It generates random color sequences, tracks user input, validates responses, and advances the sequence with each correct round, providing instant feedback for mistakes.
